  mcsb: 0 # shuffle all of the 4, any combination of m, c, s and b will shuffle the respective item, or not if it's missing, so you can add more options here
accessibility:
  items: 0 # item accessibility means you can get all inventory items. So a key could lock itself, but you can fill your inventory
  locations: 1 # location accessibility means you can access every location in your seed and get all 216 checks
  none: 0 # no accessibility means your seed is "beatable only", meaning any items you do not need to beat the game can be unreachable. This can mean you have to defeat ganon with a lamp and master sword.
progressive: #not available in bonta's multiworld at this time. If you want this option, make sure the host uses the correct Multiworld
  on: 1 # progressive items, you will always get progressive items like swords in their order: figher sword -> master sword -> tempered sword -> golden sword
  off: 0 # turns progressive items off, so you can find, for example, silver arrows before a bow
  random: 0 # rolls a 50/50 chance for each potentially progressive item. So, for example, you can have progressive swords but non-progressive mittens
entrance_shuffle:
  none: 1 # no entrance shuffle
  dungeonssimple: 0 # shuffle just dungeons amongst each other, swapping dungeons entirely, so Hyrule Castle is always 1 dungeon
  dungeonsfull: 0 # shuffle any dungeon entrance with any dungeon interior, so Hyrule Castle can be 4 different dungeons
  simple: 0 #dungeons are shuffled with each other and the other entrances are shuffled with each other
  restricted: 0 #dungeons still shuffle along each other but connects other entrances more feely with each other while keeping entrances in one world
  full: 0 # mixes caves and dungeons freely, except for confining all entrances to one world
  crossed: 0 #introduces cross world connectors
  insanity: 0 #any entrance can lead to any other entrance
